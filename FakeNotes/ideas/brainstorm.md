# Brainstorm: Project Ideas

## Overview

This file collects quick project ideas and experiments to try with the notes workspace.

## Ideas

### CLI tooling

- Build a tiny CLI to export notes as JSON
- Add `list` and `search` subcommands

### Testing

- Add an automated test that creates, reads, and indexes notes
- Simulate nested folders and different markdown features

### UX experiments

- Create a tagging UX experiment: color chips + multi-select filters
- Try live folder-watcher that updates an in-memory index

## Constraints

- Keep tools small and dependency-light so tests are reproducible

## Action plan

- [ ] Choose one idea to prototype
- [ ] Create a minimal README and example usage

Notes: this file should be easy to extend with new headings and sub-ideas.
