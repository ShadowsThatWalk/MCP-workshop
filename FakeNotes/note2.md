# Quick Note: CLI experiments

A few short ideas and links to try when testing the notes system.

## TL;DR

- Use this note to test parsing, headings, and code snippets.

## Test Cases

### Tag search

- Try searching for the tags: `random`, `test`.

### Checklists

- [ ] reproduce search
- [ ] verify link preview

### Code sample

```sh
echo "indexing notes..."
# simulate a tiny CLI output
```

> Note: blockquotes are handy to check rendering.

### Mini table

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Tags | available |
| Export | pending |

Keep this file varied so parsers and renderers get exercised.
